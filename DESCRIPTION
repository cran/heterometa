Description: Published meta-analyses routinely present one of the
   measures of heterogeneity introduced in Higgins and Thompson
   (2002) <doi:10.1002/sim.1186>. For critiquing articles
   it is often better to convert to another of
   those measures. Some
   conversions are provided here and confidence intervals are also
   available.
